# OpenSolve Pipe Web Configuration

# API URL - used for server-side rendering (SSR) requests to the backend.
# In the browser, requests use relative URL /api/v1 (proxied by Vite in dev,
# rewritten by vercel.json in production).
# For Vercel deployment, set this to your deployed backend URL, e.g.:
#   PUBLIC_API_URL=https://opensolve-pipe-api.railway.app
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
